The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use open source software library for accessing and controlling ASUS Aura RGB devices on motherboards and RAM modules.  The ASUS Aura controller appears to be used on RAM products such as G.Skill's Trident Z RGB.  Ideally we would be able to get AURA working on both Windows and Linux.  This project has been spun off of Keyboard Visualizer's AsusAuraWindows branch.
