The E1.31 Streaming ACN protocol is a lighting control protocol used by many lighting controllers.  It implements a form of DMX512 over Ethernet.  It can be used to drive RGB addressable LED strips via a number of open source controller firmwares such as ESPixelStick and WLED.

OpenRGB uses libe131 by hhromic for E1.31: https://github.com/hhromic/libe131

OpenRGB can send E1.31 packets to control these devices.  Since E1.31 does not provide an autodetection mechanism, E1.31 devices must be configured in a configuration file called e131.txt, placed in the same directory as the OpenRGB executable file.

The format of an E1.31 device entry should match the following example:

```
e131_device_start
Window Lights
num_leds=25
start_channel=1
start_universe=6
rgb_order=RGB
type=LINEAR
e131_device_end
```

This configuration creates a device called "Window Lights" on universe 6 that starts at channel 1 and contains 25 RGB LEDs, with byte order R, G, B.  This zone is considered a linear zone for effects.  At the moment, the RGB order is unimplemented and output will be R, G, B regardless of this setting.  Devices with more than 512 channels in use (3 channels per LED) will automatically roll over to the next universe.

# Matrix Configuration

You can configure an E1.31 device as an LED matrix.  Matrix configuration is done by adding these parameters to your E1.31 device entry.

| Parameter     | Value                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| matrix_width  | Width of matrix         |
| matrix_height | Height of matrix        |
| matrix_order  | One of the following:   |
|               | HORIZONTAL_TOP_LEFT     |
|               | HORIZONTAL_TOP_RIGHT    |
|               | HORIZONTAL_BOTTOM_LEFT  |
|               | HORIZONTAL_BOTTOM_RIGHT |
|               | VERTICAL_TOP_LEFT       |
|               | VERTICAL_TOP_RIGHT      |
|               | VERTICAL_BOTTOM_LEFT    |
|               | VERTICAL_BOTTOM_RIGHT   |
